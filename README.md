# Wifi-Password
This script retrieves the password of a network to which you are already connected.

# Example
Let's say you ask your friend Tom for the Wi-Fi password at his house. Instead of showing you the password, he types it in and connects your laptop. With this script, you can download it, run it in VSCode, and it will display the username and password of the network to which you are connected. Now you can enjoy using the network without having to ask for the password again.

# Note!!!
This script only works if your device is already connected to a network.

# Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to see the password of a network if your device is already connected to it, and also in case you forget the network password.
